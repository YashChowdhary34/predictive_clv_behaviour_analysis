## Introduction

This project delves into analyzing and predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by examining customer purchasing patterns, behavior trends, and engagement metrics. 
Using a real-world dataset, we analyze and derive insights to improve customer retention strategies and forecast future revenue streams.

## Business Problems That We'll Be Answering
- Which customers have the highest spending probability in the next 90 days (clv - 90days)
- Which customers have recently purchased but are unlikely to buy (survival analysis)
- Which customers were predicted to purchase but didn't (missed opportunities)

## Dataset
We are working with CDNow Dataset, CDNow was a Dot-Com company that went bust in the early 2000s. They then donated the dataset, it's highly reliable, realistic,
and perfect for our particular use case.
**Features**
- Customer ID
- Purchase Date
- Purchase Quantity
- Order Value

## Feature Engineering

### Objectives
- Extract features encapsulating customer behavior, such as recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM).
- Generate advanced predictors like average spending, purchase trends, and customer segmentation metrics.

### Key Features Created
- **Recency**: Days since the last purchase.
- **Frequency**: Total number of purchases.
- **Monetary Metrics**: 
  - `price_sum`: Total spend across transactions.
  - `price_mean`: Average spend per transaction.
- **spend_90_total**: Predicted customer lifetime value (CLV) for the next 90 days.

### Methods
- Data aggregation and grouping based on `customer_id`.
- Handling missing data and outliers.
- Normalization and scaling of numerical features for model compatibility.

## Spend Amount Prediction Model

### Objectives
- Train a model to predict `spend_90_total` using features derived from the Feature Engineering phase.
- Evaluate and optimize model performance.

### Methodology
- **Model Used**: Gradient Boosting Regressor (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
- **Feature Selection**:
  - Recency, Frequency, Monetary metrics, and additional behavioral features.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

### Workflow
1. **Data Splitting**: Stratified train-test split.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using grid search and cross-validation.
3. **Performance Analysis**: Visualizing predictions versus actual spend values to ensure reliability.

### Outcomes
- Model achieves robust prediction accuracy with MAE and RMSE within acceptable thresholds.
- Feature importance analysis highlights key drivers of customer spending behavior.

### Model Performance
**Modelâ€™s predictions are off by about 9.65 units which for out particular dataset evaluates to 9-10 dollars**

## Spend Probability Prediction Model

### Objectives
- Build a classification model to predict `spend_90_flag` (a binary indicator of future purchases).
- Combine predictions with spending amounts to prioritize high-value customers.

### Methodology
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier or Logistic Regression.
- **Features**: Same as the Spend Amount Prediction Model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
  - Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC-AUC) Curve

### Workflow
1. **Label Encoding**: Transform `spend_90_flag` to a binary variable.
2. **Model Training**: Employ robust training techniques to handle class imbalance.
3. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust decision thresholds to maximize business-specific metrics.

### Outcomes
- High accuracy and ROC-AUC scores ensure reliable probability predictions.
- Predictions integrated with spend amount estimates enable targeted marketing and retention strategies.

### Model Performance
**ROC-AUC: 0.84**
